# Overview

This project implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to transform photographs into artworks in the style of Claude Monet. It was developed as a submission for the Kaggle competition "I'm Something of a Painter Myself."


The full report can be viewed [here](http://www.andrewdsimms.com/using_gans_to_create_art/).


# Model Code

GAN models and training are in `./week_5.py`

Report source code is in `./quarto/index.qmd`. Rendered documents `./week_5_report.ipynb` (image
rendering is not working),  `./week_5_report.pdf` (image rendering works) and the final output can
